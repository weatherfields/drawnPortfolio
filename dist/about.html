            Los Angeles ... a place unique to the world with no ceiling on how
            much success one can achieve. Where people go to turn their dreams
            into tangible manifestations. That's where I've been for the last 12
            years, accomplishing just that. I'm a huge success. I act in
            surreal, thought-piece movies that change the way people see the
            world. When I release a new song it gets millions of streams within
            the first few hours, across multiple platforms. I'm working on a
            novel, writing a new screenplay, have my own line of Kombucha,
            alkaline water, ironic t-shirts, serious shoes, biodegradable hats
            made from post consumer waste (that one's not doing too well), and a
            great tasting fair trade organic Mexican coffee brand. I have
            upwards of a hundred million dollars, a beautiful wife, two kids, a
            house on Mullholland, and one in "The 'Bu". However my wife lives in
            Calabasas ... because the schools are better for the kids, not
            because we can't stand each other
          </p>
          <p class="p-bio">
            Oh ... wait a second, none of that is true. Most of my time in LA
            (and Oakland) was spent spinnig my wheels, going on auditions,
            playing shows that nobody went to, working for bigshots who payed as
            if they were destitute, dealing with collaborators who were lazy and
            riddled with drugs, and struggling just to pay the rent and eat. Of
            course that excludes the time in which I squatted in a warehouse for
            a few months ... I dind't have to pay rent then.
          </p>
          <p class="p-bio">
            In the end I put what I was passionate about on the back burner. I
            got a job as a computer repair tech in Hollywood so that I could
            have a (slightly) better quality of life. A story in a book as old
            as time with a billion pages. I don't know where my story is going,
            but writing another page in that book isn't part of it.
